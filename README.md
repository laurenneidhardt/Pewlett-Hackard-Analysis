# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: ##
The purpose of this analysis is to help anticipate staffing issues when a large percentage of the company is eligible for retirement. According to our research around 14% out of the current employee population, will be eligible for retirement based on their birthdates. We are also evaluating a possible mentorship program with the outgoing retirees. 

## Results: ##

* I'm surprised by how few retirees are eligible for mentorship
* Not sure why the eligibility for mentorship was limited to those born in 1965. Seems to limit the data too much.
* These results could be taken a step further, removing non-current employees for the retiring unique titles.
* The list for unique titles is an expected outcome, the most departments effected byt the "Silver Tsunami" are the largest departments.



## Summary: ##

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? ###
I think we need more information here as far as what denotes eligibility, how does hire date play into this and are we assuming everyone will retire once eligible? Have any surveys been done amongst the 33k employees. Will the company force retirement? 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? ###
The numbers are very different between how many employees are eligible for mentorship vs how many current employees are in those departments, see the images below. I made two additional queries to see how the mentors would be divided up in their respective departments with the rest of the company.

 Would we be open to expanding eligibility outside of those born in 1965? Are we able to add more mentors on an annual basis?
